# Overview

**So, you have an amazing C++ application for which you need some plotting capability.** You have searched around, and discovered that C++ is not very famous when it comes to plotting libraries compared to other programming languages, such as Python, for example, which has the nice package **[matplotlib]**. The idea of this **sciplot project** is to enable C++ programmers to conveniently plot beautifull graphs as other high-level programming languages out there. All plotting capabilities of **sciplot** are powered by **[gnuplot]**.
